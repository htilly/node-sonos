** Installation **

In order to get the bot up and running you need to do the following.

* Pre-requisit: *

1: #Slack-group with admin rights
2: A server / machine that can run node.js
3: A working Sonos player configured with Spotify
4: You need to know the IP of your Sonos player.

Note: There is also options to install in docker or Heroku. 


#Slack

Create a bot in #Slack.
You need to give it a name, and write down the API Token. You will need this in your setting file later.
Hit "Save Integration" and you are done in #Slack.

Optional you can give the bot some nice namne, icon etc.

For an icon, have a look in zenmusic/doc/images/ZenMusic.png


Node.js - Zenmusic!

This guide assume you have git, node.js and NPM installed, and running linux =)

Run the following commands in your terminal:

cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/htilly/zenmusic.git
cd zenmusic
npm install
cp config.json.example config.json

Almost there... some simple configuration first.
Edit config.json with your favorit text editor.

Replace:

"music-admin" - with the #slack channel you want the bot to respond to admin commands.`
"music" - with the #slack channel you want the bot to be a DJ in =)`
"IP_TO_SONOS" - with the (static) IP of you sonos player / controller.`
"SLACK:TOKEN" - with the token you got for the bot in "Slack.`
"US" - with the country that you use Spotify.
75 - with the maximum volume you can set the Sonos to via "setvolume" in #Slack

And last thing... start the bot!

Type:
node index.js

You should see something like:

[Sat Apr 30 2016 21:44:10 GMT+0200 (CEST)] INFO Connecting... Welcome to Slack. You are @zenmusicbot of Schibsted Media Group You are in: #music As well as: music-admin 



** Known Issues **

If you for any reason get the following 500 error in the logs:

Error: HTTP response code 500 for "urn:schemas-upnp-org:service:AVTransport:1#AddURIToQueue"

Please try to change the following code in index.js. You need to change this in three places.
DonÂ´t know what this is happening, but it has been confirmed on at least two systems :/

// Old version.. New is supposed to fix 500 problem...
// sonos.addSpotifyQueue(spid, function (err, res) {

sonos.addSpotify(spid, function (err, res) {
